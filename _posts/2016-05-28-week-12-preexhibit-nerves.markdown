 I really can't believe we're so close to the Exhibit! It definitely doesn't feel like 12 weeks ago we were just starting this course. In Friday's session for once we didn't need to set up our whole installation, because there really was no need. We believe that we have done enough testing, and we're confident everything will run smoothly for the exhibit. We did however set up the projector so we could use it instead of a monitor with the Mac Mini for a couple quick fixes. One being we had to reverse the prompt word 'TOUCH' which is displayed on the canvas when it has not been interacted with for a little while. Because the Kinect and visuals stuff is already reversed, we are using the projector in the regular mode not the rear-projection mode, which Daniel forgot about when he hard-coded in the particles to spell out 'TOUCH'. We also fixed a few minor things with the music, mainly re-mapping the gain to the track volume instead, and inverting a few ranges.  

 Other than that, we have finished our flyers and posters for the exhibit, we may need to design a couple more posters to hang around the main room pointing people into Lab 2, since we are the only group in there. I also finished off the video today, adding in more recent clips and shortening it to just 2 minutes. I think it gets the point across a bit quicker now, and it definitely looks better with the real visuals!  

 This is probably going to be my last blog post before the exhibit, especially with the 3800 presentation on Monday. I'm really excited for the exhibit, it will be great to see everyone's projects in action and be able to interact with them finally. The last potential drama we might have between now and the exhibit will be getting our installation there. I heard a few concerns about fitting the large metal pieces into the van, but if I can fit them in a Corolla hatchback with them sticking in through to the front seats, surely they can fit in a van! I guess we will have to wait until Monday to see...
